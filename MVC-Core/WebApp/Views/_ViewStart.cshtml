@* We create this view to allow us to only need to define this layout in one file instead of defining the layout in every single view. This view is ran first before any other view is
ran. Without this file we'd would need to declare this code on every single view we wanted to use the _Layout template to render the view. *@

    Layout = "_Layout";
